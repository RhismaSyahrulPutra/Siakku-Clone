<h1 align="center">SIAKku UPI: A Modern UI Redesign</h1>

### ðŸŽ¯ Project Objective

<p align="justify">This UI project was born out of my personal concern as a student regarding the user interface of SIAKku UPI, which I feel is outdated and no longer aligned with modern design trends. Through this project, I aimed to create an alternative UI concept that not only serves as a creative outlet for myself but also as a potential inspiration for future improvements to the SIAKku application. Beyond being a self-fulfilling creative exercise, this project reflects my hope for a more user-friendly and visually appealing SIAKku in the future.</p>

## ðŸ§° Tech Stack List

## ðŸ“„ Pages Developed

<p align="justify">In the early stages of this project, I have successfully developed several UI pages. However, some pages have not been created yet due to privacy and security considerations related to the original application. For now, I am focusing on building pages that I believe are safe to showcase. The pages I have developed so far are as follows:</p>

- **Welcome Page**
- **Login Page**
- **Home Page**
- **Dashboard Page**
- **News Page**
- **Academic Calendar Page**
- **Profile Page**
- **Achievements Page**
- **E-KTM Page**

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This project and the pages created do not represent the actual SIAKku application. They are original designs and concepts I created with the aim of making the application more optimal and user-friendly.
